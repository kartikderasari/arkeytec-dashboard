# Arkeytec Dashboard 
A simple front-end admin application of a SaaS product which is used for viewing and managing the Architectural drawings generated by Artificial Intelligence algorithms designed at Arkeytec.  

The easiest way to use Arkeytec Dashboard is to navigate to https://app.speckle.systems and login at your server.  Data will strictly be transferred between the client (the app in your browser) and your server. <br> This works within private networks, amongst firewalls, etc. as long as you have a SSL certificate for your server (ie, non-https server adresses will not work).

## Fresh installation for a speckle server deployment
1. `cd ~/${your server install location}/plugins`
2. `git clone https://github.com/kartikderasari/arkeytec-dashboard.git`
3. `cd arkeytec-dashboard`
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run build`
6. `Restart your server, and navigate to its root address - done!`

### If you have previously installed the Arkeytec Dashboard frontend plugin, you should be able to just run the following commands from the plugin's folder 

1. `git fetch`
2. `git pull`
3. `npm install - to make sure to pull along any potential new dependencies`
4. `npm run build`

## Development notes
To start a development server: `npm run dev` <br>
To build for production: `npm run build`
